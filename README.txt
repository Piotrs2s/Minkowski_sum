Minkowski addiction (also known as dilation) of two sets of position vectors A and B in Euclidean space is formed by adding each vector in A to each vector in B, i.e., the set

What it does: 
In this case Minkowski addiction is used to recognize area around obstacle for robot. Program generates few obstacles and finds dangerous area which should be avoided.

How it works:
Alghoritm finds vertices of all obstacles and creates points of dangerous area based on them, then points that do not belong to circuit are find and deleted, then area is created.

Application:
Minkowski addiction finds application for example in robot programming or 3D modeling.
